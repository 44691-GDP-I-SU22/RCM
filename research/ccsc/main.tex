\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we consider a problem to assist researchers for managing research papers read by them. Our broad approach is to develop a web application, where researchers could upload their interested papers with topic, year, title, and technique. Upon uploading a paper, they can read the paper,  write and save comments about the paper. To develop the application, we have used React, which is an open source JavaScript library for creating interactive website and standalone application. For storing users' information and research articles, we have used Firebase database.
