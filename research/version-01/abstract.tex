\begin{abstract} \cite{richards2005mixed} \cite{wagstaff2001constrained} In this paper, we consider the problem of avoiding the loss of plants due to natural environment, such as, infertile soil, weeds and darkness. Our approach is based on hydroponic techniques, where we first develop an environment for the plants to grow in the water. Then, we develop a monitoring and controlling system using Internet of Things, where we sense data from the hydroponic environment. Then, appropriate amount of water, nutrients, lights will be decided by the system. Based on the results  returned, we  manually supply growing factor (water, nutrient, light) to the plants. We build a hydroponic environment using internet of things, such as, micro-controller, sensors, and submersible pumps. Finally, we have performed experiments for pepper in both natural and hydroponic environment, where we have observed height, health, and yield on weekly basis.

%	 Natural sunlight is widely recognized as the best source for plant growth and development. Some plants might not get enough light throughout the winter and die due lack of maintenance. To promote quicker or even more balanced growth. We want to employ the hydroponics technique, which enables us to provide plants the necessary nutrients in an artificial environment utilizing red and blue LED lights that facilitate photosynthesis in plants. These techniques were interfaced with IoT for controlling the system via the internet. The main objective of this research is to maintain the plants in their natural state by monitoring the factors that increase both plant and human lifetime. This is a Mobile Integrated and smart irrigation system using IOT to control the water supply and monitor the plants environment using a Smartphone.
